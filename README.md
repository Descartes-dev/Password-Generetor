# Password-Generetor
This is a simple password generator built with Python. It allows the user to generate secure and random passwords by specifying:
- A minimum length
- Whether to include numbers
- Whether to include special characters

The password is built using random choices from letters, digits, and symbols, and ensures it meets the selected criteria.

This is my first real project, and I will improve it in the next version by fixing the logic and adding more features like strength estimation and multiple password generation.
